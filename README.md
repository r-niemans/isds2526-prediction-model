# Predicting 30-Day Mortality following AMI with Random Forests

This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating prediction models as part of the **ISDS2526** course project. The code explores different machine learning models and resampling strategies to compare their performance in a classification task. The project develops a full machine learning pipeline to predict 30-day mortality risk for patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) using a Random Forest architecture. 

# Scripts and files 
- `all_models.py` – Contains model definitions and training functions.
- `main_functions.py` – Core functions for running experiments and evaluations.
- `resampling.py` – Resampling strategies for balancing training data.
- `rf_bo.py` – Random Forest model with Bayesian optimization (hyperparameter tuning).
- `model_results.csv` – Results from different models and configurations.

##  Requirements

Install the required dependencies ( e.g. `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`) before running the code.
